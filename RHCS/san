SAN commands
rescan luns
For RHEL5 boxes, the rescan commands are as follows
(Do Not do this on RHEL4 outside of a planned maintenance - there is risk of kernel panic)

1. Run powermt display dev=all to determine the HBA numbers. The HBA numbers are the first item in each path entry and are to the left of the "qla2xxx"

2. Run echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host#/scan for each HBA (substituting "#" with the appropriate HBA number)

Warning: DO NOT run an issue_lip. This is unnecessary and will likely cause a DB outage and/or kernel panic.

3. Run powermt display dev=all

Verify that new LUN is present

4. powermt update lun_names

5. Run powermt save

to make sure the new lun is saved.

echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/scan

echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/scan

emcpdiscover

Then run

powermt display dev=all
