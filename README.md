# quick_scripts

Free feel to use, modify, fork or what ever you want. Some of the directories have single files, I have'nt gotten to splitting them up just yet.

As per the license there is no warranty and these scripts are provided 'AS-IS'... basically, if something breaks, you broke, not me :)

Sysstat and recap are used by some of them. More info below on them

Sysstat is the standard Repos (yum install sysstat / apt-get install sysstat)
Recap is in Github - https://github.com/rackerlabs/recap

Have fun!
