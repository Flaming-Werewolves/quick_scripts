# quick_scripts

Free feel to use, modify, fork or what ever you want.

As per the license there is no warranty and these scripts are provided 'AS-IS'... basically, if something breaks, you broke, not me :)

I have a folder of scripts (sar-recap_scripts )that use Sysstat and Recap - Install these to use those scripts.

Sysstat is the standard Repos (yum install sysstat / apt-get install sysstat)
Recap is in Github - https://github.com/rackerlabs/recap

Have fun!
